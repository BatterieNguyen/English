# Only government action can solve housing shortage in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

## Outcome
  Housing shortage has become a serious urban social issue in may parts of the world. It has been argued that only when the government has taken actions, can the demand for homes be fulfilled. Yet to the best of my knowledge, the government alone cannot cope well with housing shortages.
  
   One of the main objections to government intervention is that it would hamper the private sector and simultaneously, pose a huge burden upon the state. In countries where the government is on a tight budget and the homeless population is large, the involvement of private property developers is required and recommended. Not only does it release the governement from the burden of funding large-sized construction programmes but it also fosters the housing industry. Given its role in attracting public consumptions and accelerating economic development, the housing indsutry should be at the mercy of the market, rather than the government.
   
  Another drawbac of state control over the housing market is that it could resuslt in the stagnancy of construction quality, functionality, facilities and other aspects of housing. Apartment blocks or residential constructions would be built in a similar pattern and the cityscape would be monotonous. Excessive uniformity, especially in the size and number of rooms, will fail to meet comprehensive requirements raised by citizens on properties.

  Despite these objections, the government intervention is essential in some segments of the market and can render more resistance to citizens. Single parents, the people with disabilities and other disadvantaged pepople are among those who are not ready to afford commercial housing. The government can provide them either with housing allowance to purchase their private properties or directly with economical houses.

  As indicated above, in addressiang homelessness and inadequate housing, the joint effort of both government and private sector is required. While government intervention would impede the property market and negatively influence the supply and demand relationship, the government assistance is essential for low-income families and vulnerable individuals in need of housing.

As the government has the unique intergerence, solving the housing shortage, they would be expected to have smarter decisions in allocating space effectively to fulfill the priority of citizens.
