### `Brainstorming`
# _1. Positive_
* give a competitive edge in brand awareness → links the customers to the business → [in simple term] help the image/ detail information reach the targeted audiences → 
  * boost its sales → facilitate the economic well-being/ create economic intensive/ guarantee the high rate of turnover of the manufactured product → sustainability of the company/ business.
  * [if not necessarily for sale stimulation] draw the attention of public →
* [possibility] non-commercial advertisements → … → discharge the duty as a propagation improving the quality of lifestyle of society. → [In this sense] it is premature to judge that advertising has no redeeming feature.
  * provide information on such issues as anti-smoking, anti-drug, AIDS, healthy eating habits
  * [with the passing of time] advertising is believed to serve a higher purpose than only boosting the sales → many thought-provoking ads including values (love, family, environmental protection, education) also are welcomed by the audience
increase the sense of satisfaction → [in this tactic] stress the attributes of a products that link to the customer tastes/ the shopping preference of customer → divergent advertising → compare and make decision based on their own interests

supply/ provide adequate and accurate information → make customers knowledgeable consumers/ users

# _2. Negative_
Misrepresentation/ give products an exaggerated account/ cross the line of a little exaggeration → [in this tactic] stress the attributes of a products (that link to the customer tastes/ the shopping preference of customer) or the effectiveness of product → while play down the others (bad consequences of overeating a type of foods → divert the attention of audience → make them more susceptible to the effect of commercial

unwelcome intrusion → the advent/ availability of the internet → rise on an unprecedented scale (social media, web browsers, ... ) → [while] not always most of them are useful information nor meet their interest to know → cause annoyance → refuse the advertisement without considering whether that is thought provoking/ well-meaning or not.

contribute to the unplanned purchase of customers → with the high frequency of seeing advertisements → visuals (banners, signs, flags, posters, …) → display everywhere in their mundane/ routine shopping trip → successfully turn an intended shoppers into impulsive buyers buyers → make people purchase products more than necessary

create the peer effect → deliver a strong message that the advertised product are owned/ purchased by most of other customers →  make people lead materialistic lifestyle → people are more concerned with the labels, brands of the products than with its quality and practical value → 
form a short-term-use society → where people tend to replace a new products



However, this influence is just a part of the whole picture behind the aim of most advertising itself. 
the rise of perfection over the realism → [according to the advertisers' wish or even the targeted audience the focus, rather than being a perfect reflection of the whole society] those advertisements are selective in who they represented → [most of the cases] those representation centered on is a very limited sample of population whose body supposed to be flawless and attractive → [unconsciously] this unattainable human (physical) perfection become standardized among society → manufacture the envy → decrease the level of satisfaction and make people less happier.
[under such advertising tactics] the advertised products appear to be a life-transforming chance for consumers with the implicit promise that they can transform into their enviable people. 
 [it comes as no surprise that] 
[it is generally accepted as true]
