## _1.Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve its standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?_

[opinion] there are a couple of complementary components if operated properly → economic development and environmental protection are not inimical, but complementary. They are intertwined and can be promoted simultaneously. 

AGREE → [opinion] there is no economic target that can be attained without some sacrifice made to the environment.

a concrete link between environmental awareness of business and their favorable impression on the general public



Vocabulary | Meaning | Side Note
---------- | ------- | ---------
complementary | two people or things are different but together form a useful or attractive combination of skills, qualities or physical features | 


## _2. Many people believe that human society has developed into a throw-away society, which is filled with plastic bags and rubbish. What are the causes and solutions?_

people ~ citizens
Unethical business
throw-away society ~ 
waste disposal 
low/ inefficient progress in waste treatment
plastic bags, rubbish
durable materials, non-recyclable materials
Industrial waste (heavy metal, chemicals, plastic)

CAUSE
Despite its sizable influence, many citizens have not yet realized the seriousness of this issue.
Economic advantage
The problem of Waste disposal exists due to people’s ever-growing demand for manufactured goods
The increment in the garbage is a natural result of social and economic development → Unethical businesses are the main creators of industrial waste (heavy metal, chemicals, plastic) → people’s quest for a better living standard gives them incentives to manufacture a rich variety of consumer goods | disregard the potential impact on the environment.
This practice can date back to the earliest days of the industrial revolution → produce enormous waste that is unable to be recycled | cause an environmental disaster.
use virgin materials, rather than recyclable materials in the course of production.
Awareness
Slow response to the impact of this problem on the environment
Low awareness of opportunities to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste → do not have a firm stand against over-consumption and excessive production of disposable items
not environmentally conscious → dispose of wastes whenever and wherever they consider convenient
=> That is why many communities are facing a particularly difficult position in waste treatment.



=> Tackling this problem depends on individuals’ efforts to keep the waste to a minimum but also on businesses’ attempts to optimize their manufacture and reduce the inputs.

## _3. Climate change is a big environmental problem that has become critical in the last couple of decades. Some people claim that humans should stop burning fossil fuels and use only alternative energy resources, such as wind and solar power. Others say that oil, gas and coal are essential for many industries, and not using them will lead to economic collapse. Discuss both views and offer your opinions_

Climate change has engendered valid concerns in recent decades. To address the current situation, some people believe that fossil fuels should be completely replaced by alternative energy, while others disagree on the grounds that traditional energy resources are vital to various industries and detrimental consequences can be caused should the use of it be abolished. This essay will discuss both views and explain why I side with the latter.

It is understandable why opponents of fossil fuels advocate its eradication. The combustion of coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as the process of mining and extracting them, damages the environment and destroys habitats. By stop using them, the environment and ecosystem might be improved, thus, in theory, declining the rate of climate change. Albeit being reasonable to a certain extent, I find that school of thought to be naive and short-sighted. At this point, eliminating fossil fuels cannot immediately ameliorate the current situation as climate change has exceeded the threshold at which such extreme undertaking could take any notable effect. As ill-considered a proposal as it is, the odds are that it is very likely to be counterproductive, the reasonings of which would be elevated on alongside with the discussion of the second opinion.
 
Vital industries, such as transportation and manufacture of consumer goods, would not function properly were we to abandon fossil fuels as the available alternative energy industry is yet to be capable of fully substituting conventional resources. In addition, renewable energy is high-maintenance and costly to operate comparing to non-renewables, making it unideal a candidate for the world’s primary energy resource. The booming world population requires an ever-growing economy, and relying on an insufficient resource would lead to catastrophic consequences such as a global economic collapse. In that scenario, hunger, violence, and worldwide energy deficit would destroy everything we intended to preserve when making the erroneous decision to stop using fossil fuels. 

In conclusion, while it is true that the use of fossil fuels contributes to the accelerating change in the Earth’s climate, it would be imprudent to force the abolition of traditional energy resources as alternative energy is yet to be able to carry our economy. The best solution available is a flexible hybrid utilization of energy resources that could give us the best of both worlds.

## _4. It is said that the best way to solve the world's environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?_

The burning if fossil fuels is universally recognisd as the largest source of emissions of greenhouse gases in the world and one of the key factors responsible for global warming. WHen there is a growing concern about the destructive effects of global warming and other environmental problems, some people argue that the best approach to deal with such problems is to increase fuel prices, assuming that it will lead directly to the drop in car use. This approach is productive to some extent, but some other measures should be given equal consideration.
