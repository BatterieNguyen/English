### `Brainstorming`
# _1. Positive_
* give a competitive edge in brand awareness → links the customers to the business → [in simple term] help the image/ detail information reach the targeted audiences → 
  * boost its sales → facilitate the economic well-being/ create economic intensive/ guarantee the high rate of turnover of the manufactured product → sustainability of the company/ business.
  * [if not necessarily for sale stimulation] draw the attention of public →
* [possibility] non-commercial advertisements → … → discharge the duty as a propagation improving the quality of lifestyle of society. → [In this sense] it is premature to judge that advertising has no redeeming feature.
  * provide information on such issues as anti-smoking, anti-drug, AIDS, healthy eating habits
  * [with the passing of time] advertising is believed to serve a higher purpose than only boosting the sales → many thought-provoking ads including values (love, family, environmental protection, education) also are welcomed by the audience
increase the sense of satisfaction → [in this tactic] stress the attributes of a products that link to the customer tastes/ the shopping preference of customer → divergent advertising → compare and make decision based on their own interests

supply/ provide adequate and accurate information → make customers knowledgeable consumers/ users

# _2. Negative_
Misrepresentation/ give products an exaggerated account/ cross the line of a little exaggeration → [in this tactic] stress the attributes of a products (that link to the customer tastes/ the shopping preference of customer) or the effectiveness of product → while play down the others (bad consequences of overeating a type of foods → divert the attention of audience → make them more susceptible to the effect of commercial

unwelcome intrusion → the advent/ availability of the internet → rise on an unprecedented scale (social media, web browsers, ... ) → [while] not always most of them are useful information nor meet their interest to know → cause annoyance → refuse the advertisement without considering whether that is thought provoking/ well-meaning or not.

contribute to the unplanned purchase of customers → with the high frequency of seeing advertisements → visuals (banners, signs, flags, posters, …) → display everywhere in their mundane/ routine shopping trip → successfully turn an intended shoppers into impulsive buyers buyers → make people purchase products more than necessary

create the peer effect → deliver a strong message that the advertised product are owned/ purchased by most of other customers →  make people lead materialistic lifestyle → people are more concerned with the labels, brands of the products than with its quality and practical value → 
form a short-term-use society → where people tend to replace a new products



However, this influence is just a part of the whole picture behind the aim of most advertising itself. 
the rise of perfection over the realism → [according to the advertisers' wish or even the targeted audience the focus, rather than being a perfect reflection of the whole society] those advertisements are selective in who they represented → [most of the cases] those representation centered on is a very limited sample of population whose body supposed to be flawless and attractive → [unconsciously] this unattainable human (physical) perfection become standardized among society → manufacture the envy → decrease the level of satisfaction and make people less happier.
[under such advertising tactics] the advertised products appear to be a life-transforming chance for consumers with the implicit promise that they can transform into their enviable people. 
 [it comes as no surprise that] 
[it is generally accepted as true]

### `Sample`
 Advertising is well-known as a method of promotion, a method used by corporations to introduce their products and services to the market, attract the eye of consumers and increase sales. Crisis of advertising argue that advertising is the main drive of soaring sales of some products and services, inducing consumers to purchase what they do not actually need in their daily lives. This contention is self-evident.

 Advertisements conquer the audience mainly by sending them a message that they are lacking a specific brand or product that is likely to make them acceptable or even distinguished individuals in society. The advertisements as to medicine, dietary supplement and other life-enhancing products provide a typical example. Targetting the buyers that are doubtful or worried about health, advertisers have sought to encourage them to think that they are thresatened by such problems as malnutrition, dysfunction of any part of their bodies. Lack of the knowledge in this field, the audience will rush to buy the advertised products. Such cases are ever-present, and the audience expects an immediate positive outcome, disregarding other solutions.
 
 Advertising also works to create a best-seller image for a newly-marketed product. THe audience is tempted to buy it in the hope that they can, thus, become one of the eyewitnesses and participants of a fad. It is not uncommon that cell phone users replace their phone every year, although the phone they have abandoned is still in usable conditions. They might not actually need to make purchases so frequently, but advertising spurs them to do so. The power of advertising has too often abused by advertisers, who tend to give an exaggerated account of the popularity of a product, sonn after the product is marketed. So gullible are some buyers that they are drivento buy it. With the number of buyers growing, it will evolve into a buying craze.

 In conclusion, people should stay alert to the influence advertising has on their decision making process. As indicated above, advertising has twisted the information about what product is needed, or what product is favoured, thereby driving people to make insensible buy decisions.

### `Sample`
 It has always been difficult to access the contribution of advertising. This issue is fraught with controvery, with concern being expressed over the harmful effects of advertising. Below are some arguments against this concern.

 It is important that one of the key functions of advertising is to supply consumers with adequate and accurate information about all of the alternatives avaiable to them. Every now and then, advertising is criticised on the ground that it can manipulate consumers to follow the will of the advertiser; however, evidence supports an oppsing view that advertising merely pomotes products that are most likely to satisfy customers' wants. In simple term, it is consumers rather advertisers who decide what are advertised.

 Advertising also plays a significant role in fostering full employment and facilitating economic well-being. By conveying marketing information constantly to the target audience, advertising speeds manufactured good and therefore, sustainability of a business. It is also agreed that advertising is one of the main sponsors of a large number of other industries, for example, the entertainment industry m particularly sports, music, and theatrical events.

 Urguably, advertising is criticised every now and then for misleading the public. However, the rapid development of advertising itself has provided a solution to this problem, as the information delivered to the audiences has mde them knowledgable consumers. Under this circumstance, they can easily distinguish inferior products from quality products with their knowledge. The misleading effect of advertising will be counteracted over time.

 To summarize, advertising suggets what conssumers need and contribute partly to economic development. In this sense, advertising is of great value to people and the society. The general perception of advertising as a source of misleading information is in fact a bias.

| ---------- | ------- | --------- |
| fraught    | (adj) filled with something unpleasant | be fraught with sth |
| inferior   | (adj, formal) of lower rank; lower |
