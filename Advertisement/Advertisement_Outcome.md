### `Brainstorming`
# _Positive_
* give a competitive edge in brand awareness → links the customers to the business → [in simple term] help the image/ detail information reach the targeted audiences → 
  * boost its sales → facilitate the economic well-being/ create economic intensive/ guarantee the high rate of turnover of the manufactured product → sustainability of the company/ business.
  * [if not necessarily for sale stimulation] draw the attention of public →
* [possibility] non-commercial advertisements → … → discharge the duty as a propagation improving the quality of lifestyle of society. → [In this sense] it is premature to judge that advertising has no redeeming feature.
  * provide information on such issues as anti-smoking, anti-drug, AIDS, healthy eating habits
  * [with the passing of time] advertising is believed to serve a higher purpose than only boosting the sales → many thought-provoking ads including values (love, family, environmental protection, education) also are welcomed by the audience
increase the sense of satisfaction → [in this tactic] stress the attributes of a products that link to the customer tastes/ the shopping preference of customer → divergent advertising → compare and make decision based on their own interests

supply/ provide adequate and accurate information → make customers knowledgeable consumers/ users

# _ Negative_
Misrepresentation/ give products an exaggerated account/ cross the line of a little exaggeration → [in this tactic] stress the attributes of a products (that link to the customer tastes/ the shopping preference of customer) or the effectiveness of product → while play down the others (bad consequences of overeating a type of foods → divert the attention of audience → make them more susceptible to the effect of commercial

unwelcome intrusion → the advent/ availability of the internet → rise on an unprecedented scale (social media, web browsers, ... ) → [while] not always most of them are useful information nor meet their interest to know → cause annoyance → refuse the advertisement without considering whether that is thought provoking/ well-meaning or not.

contribute to the unplanned purchase of customers → with the high frequency of seeing advertisements → visuals (banners, signs, flags, posters, …) → display everywhere in their mundane/ routine shopping trip → successfully turn an intended shoppers into impulsive buyers buyers → make people purchase products more than necessary

create the peer effect → deliver a strong message that the advertised product are owned/ purchased by most of other customers →  make people lead materialistic lifestyle → people are more concerned with the labels, brands of the products than with its quality and practical value → 
form a short-term-use society → where people tend to replace a new products



However, this influence is just a part of the whole picture behind the aim of most advertising itself. 
the rise of perfection over the realism → [according to the advertisers' wish or even the targeted audience the focus, rather than being a perfect reflection of the whole society] those advertisements are selective in who they represented → [most of the cases] those representation centered on is a very limited sample of population whose body supposed to be flawless and attractive → [unconsciously] this unattainable human (physical) perfection become standardized among society → manufacture the envy → decrease the level of satisfaction and make people less happier.
[under such advertising tactics] the advertised products appear to be a life-transforming chance for consumers with the implicit promise that they can transform into their enviable people. 
 [it comes as no surprise that] 
[it is generally accepted as true]

## _`The society would benefit from a ban on all forms of advertising because it serves no useful purpose, and can even be damaging. Do you agree or disagree?`_

There is a school of thought that all advertising platfoms should be restricted as the belief that the society would gain no benefit from them has been popularized. In my opinion, I stand against this point of view as positive effects of advertising could be unseen by the public.

The first objection to this view point is that advertisements means maintain the economic well-being of society. By conveying marketing information to the targeted audiences, advertising can increase the sales of manufactured goods or services, and thereby, first promising the sustainability of business, later securing the employment.

Another justification is that advertising performs as a powerful tool supporting consumers in making better purchase-decision. It is obvious to notice that people are informed about available alternatives in the market and some of them are highlighted with adveanced features through advertisings videos or posters. Aligned with their personal buying experiences, consumers, therefore, may become more cautious and easily distinguish inferior products from high quality ones.
