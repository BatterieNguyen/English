# Animal Protection
## `1. Some people think that killing animals for food is cruel, but others claim that animals are a necessary part of diet. What is your opinion?`

  It is a widespread practice that livestock is raised and butchered for human consumption. Although it has been condemned as cruelty to animals, a counter-argument is that meat is the necessity for people's health and well-being. To the best of my knowledge, meat is a regular part of the diet and there is no alternative to animal food sources.

  The first justification is that animal source foods provide a wide range of nutrients that are difficult to obtain in adequate quantities from plant source foods. Insufficient intake of those nutrients will produce negative outcomes, such as poor growth. A diet with a good combination of meat and vegetable is thought to have considerable value. Some might argue that consumption of meat can pose health risks and increase the risk of foodbborne illness. This statement is fallacious, considering the fact that people can kill bacteria and remove risk factors by cooking properly and using scientific methods in manufacture.

  Another point to note is that most of the meat avaiable in supermarkets for people's consumption is produced by industrial agriculture. In view of the intense use of technology and mass production techniques, the produced livestock, poultry, or fish cannot be taken as ordinary animals but only as manufactured goods. By making use of economies of scale to produce enough food at an affordable cost, industrial farming is essential to addressing food supply problems.

  The significance of capitalising on animals as a food source is therefore undeniable, but it is important to realise that people cannot exploit animals and become addicted to meat consumption. Animal fats, for example, increase the risk of heart disease and meat is frequently associated with outbreaks of food poisoning. Meanwhile, people's insatiable desire for meat might lead to intensive livestock farming and animal slaughter, which has a direct impact on the well-being of animals worldwide.

  From the preceding discussion, one can see no reason why livestock or some other animals cannot be used as food. Switching to an animal-free diet is a personal option, but the question remains whether one can ensure sufficient intake of nutrition necessary for one's health. When there is little room for argument concerning the use of animals for meat, it is necessary to impose standards and prevent animal exploitation.

## `2. Some people strongly oppose animal experimentation, believing that it causes pain to animals, while some other people consider it necessary. What is your opinion?`
  Perhaphs, no subject in the moral cmmunity is as controversial as animal testing. Animals, many people believe, merit more humane treatment. when animal-based experiments hav long been the center of criticism, I am of the opinion that such experiments are essential to both the well-being of human beings and that of animals.

  There is little doubt, first of all, that most of the animal-based experiments are conducted for the development of technology and to date, there is little chance of finding satisfying substitutions for animals. Animals are used mainly because they bear a close resemblance to humans, either in behavior or in cell structure. The respond to external disturbaces, such as electrical shock, nearly in the same manner as humans do. There is much evidence that most of what peope know about themselves, including pain, stress, reproduction, and nutrition, is based on findings of animal-based experiments. Animal testing proves one of the main approaches to predict the risk when drugs or other products are used on humans.

  Another fact to support anumal-based experiment is that animals are not equivalent of humans, and can be used as resources for human purposes. Animals have no capacity to recognise the rights of other species. Nor will they take in consideration the interests of other species. It is possibly one of the main reasons why animals feed on each other. Human, by comparison, use animal experimentations not only for their own interests but also for the interests of animals. For example, some medical discories can be used by veterinary surgeons to give medical care and treatment to sick animals.

  Despite the justifications given for vivisection, researchers have the obligation to reduce animal testing and animal suffering. There is a growing recognition that animal tests are mostly done for commercial purposes and most of them are avoidable. For instance, the cosmetic industry has been exploiting animal experimentation simply for diversifying products and maximizing profits. the fewer cosmetic products people use, the fewer animal they have to slaughter. When scientists are emplowered to carry out cruel experiments like vivisection, such powers should not be abused.

  To summarise, one can subcribe to the notion that animals can be taken as resources intended for the benefit of humans, although meanwhile it is certain that suffering should be controlled to the minimum during experimentation.

## `3. Some people hold that we should spend money and time on the protection of wild animals while others suggest that the money should be spent on populations living in the poorest areas of the world. What is your opinion?`

  In these years, animal protection has become a subject of ongoing scientific research and an issue of concern. People take different views toward the enormous spending required by wildlife conservation. It is suggested that the spending should be diverted to helping human populations, especially those living below poverty line, because human life is more valuable than animal life. In my opinion, the investment in animal conservation is worthwhile.

  Animals, as a significant part of an ecosystem, have profound impacts on the sustainability of an ecosystem and on the well-being of humanity. All animals are connected in one way or another in food chains. For this reason, the demise of a species can lead to overpopulation or underpopulation of another species and then put this species at the verge of extinction. The natural balance will be disrupted and the ecosystem cannot be sustained. It would disable vegetation from purifying water, recycling nutrient and pollinating crops. We humans are eventually affected.

  Another justification for animal protection is that animals play a significant role in the development of industries, as an important natural resource. People derive substances and materials from animals for different purposes. A typical example is that animals provide essential substances for drug-making . It is also very common that designers and engineers turn to wildlife for inspiration. For instance, the invention of water-proof clothing drew upon the research on sharks.

  On account of those benefits, wildlife protection is a significant strategy that has far-reaching effects on the future of human. However, when implemented, this strategy should be adapted in different contexts. It should be noted that spending money simply on animals is not the approach that promises the best outcomes in all circumstance. For example, in those regions where inhabitants struggle with weak economies and have a few job sources, direct spending on any animal program would not stop people from hunting and trading animals for living. An alternative strategy is creating jobs or providing subsidies, lifting these regions out of poverty.

  From what has been discussed , animals are key components of the whole natural order and have relevance to the sustainability of an ecosystem and the interests of humanity. Animal protection is a strategy that applies to the whole world, and might vary in different circumstances.

## `4. Far too little has been done to prevent animals and plants from dying out, although people have noticed this problem for a long time. Why have people failed to improve this situation? What are your suggestions?`

  Nowadays, the progresive extinction of living species on the planet, either animals or plants, as arisen as a big environmental challenge, according to many scientists and researchers. Despite the growing concern on this issue, little progress has been made in this field. There are some factors that account for why this happended. In my opinion, this situation can be remedied, provided that some reasonable steps are taken.

# Pet Raising
## `Discuss the arguments for and against raising pets`

  In these years, animal wellfare has become a subject of controversy and it has been argued that animals should not be regarded as property by human beings or used against their own best interests. When pet raising has become a way of life in many societies around the world, it has, on the other hand, raised the question of whether it is a breach of animal rights. Below are some arguments concerning pet ownership.

  Pet animals are known for their loyalty and playful characteristics and belived to have apositive effect on the health of their owners. THe pressures of modern lifestyles are tremendous. Compared to previous generations, people are more likely to live independently and away from their families at the present time. Adopting a pet animal as a companion can give quality to the owner's life, and help reduce stress and blood pressure. It is also regarded as a solution to the feeling of isolation and loneliness. These two facts are combined to justify why there are an increasing number of people now depending on pet animals as companion or even a therapy.

  Raising pets benefits pets as well. Providing companionship and giving pleasure to their owners, pets receive loving care and attention in return. Some might argue that holding a pet is unnatural, because pet animals would lose their original way of life. However, peple should meanwhile recognize that some animals are unfitted to the wild environment. It is normally wrong that people force animals to struggle with food, clean water and other necessities in the wild environment.

  Keeping an animal is therefore beneficial, but, notably, there is no guarantee that every pet lives a happy life. Ignorance of an animal's needs for space, exercise or contact with members of the same species, for instance, has been found as a common problem with raising pets. It should also be noted that many people adopt pets for wrong reasons, such as a statement of affluence or a status of symbol. They are very likely to abandon or even kill pets when their initial interest subsides. When holding pet animals has become popular, other problems will result, such as pollution caused by excess manure.

  Based on the facts outlined above, people can conclude that pet-keeping is a tradition that can be either good or bad, from an ethical point of view. On the one hand, it gives people companionship and great pleasure and animals obtain a loving home and a happy life. On the other, inappropriate treatment can rob animals of the basic right to well-being.
