`Some people think that too much attention and too many resources are given to the protection of wild animals and birds. Do you agree or disagree?` (26/02/2022)


Wildlife has far-reaching effects // profound effects on human life and even in the future, their role still cannot be denied.

Proven in many scientific researches, there is a concrete link between the flourishing wildlife and the well-being of humanity.

1. Sustainability of the ecosystem


In my opinion, Humankind is still the only focus to direct all resources and attention towards and the loss of wildlife, if it is a case, could be solved by different strategies managed by the government.

should devote more resources to more pressing issues

Well-being of society
[Despite the humans’ living conditions improved] there are still areas where people still cannot attain basic necessities (education, health, shelter, food) → It is a must for the government to maintain the strong appeal for assisting disadvantaged individuals rather than other species.


Counterargument

wild animals do not appear to have the same impact on humans as other ones → [Ex] … → [without the appearance of …] people still continued to develop at a rapid pace as they do today → [in my interpretation] usually protect animals out of ethical concerns → [thus] should not go overboard in any effort to save them.
It seems to be naive and short-sighted to emphasize that spending attention and resources simply on animals is the approach that promises the best outcomes. In fact, the root causes putting those living creatures at serious risk come from the lack of knowledge about the value of animals and the greed for deriving huge profitability from body parts of these species. Even if more advanced technology and national budgets flood into the preservation, there is still an increasing number of poachers who damage wild animals and the concern over this issue cannot be solved radically. In this sense, different approaches to raising public awareness and stricter policies imposed on hunting animals should be highly recommended simultaneously.

### Outcome


-----
`It is a natural process for animal species to become extinct. There is no reason why people should try to prevent this from happening. To what extent do you agree or disagree?`
