## `2. Some people think that killing animals for food is cruel, but others claim that animals are a necessary part of diet. What is your opinion?`

  It is a widespread practice that livestock is raised and butchered for human consumption. Although it has been condemned as cruelty to animals, a counter-argument is that meat is the necessity for people's health and well-being. To the best of my knowledge, meat is a regular part of the diet and there is no alternative to anima food sources.

  The first jsutification is that animal source foods provide a wide range of nutrients that are difficult to obtain in adequate quantities from plant source foods. Insufficient intake of those utrients will produce negative outcomes, such as poor growth. A diet with a good combination of meat and vegetable is thought to have considerable value. Some might argue that consumption of meat can pose health risks and increase the risk of foodbborne illness. This statement is fallacious, considering the fact that people can kill bacteria and remove risk factors by cooking properly and using scientific methods in manufacture.

  Another point to note is that most of the meat avaiable in supermarkets for people's consumption is produced by industrial agriculture. In view of the intense use of technology and mass production techniques, the produced livestock, poultry, or fish cannot be taken as ordinary animals but only as manufactured goods. By making use of economies of scale to produce enough food at an affordable cost, industrial farming is essential to addressing food supply problems.

  The significance of capitalising on animals as a food source is therefore undeniable, but it is important to realise that people cannot exploit animals and become addicted to meat consumption. Animal fats, for example, increase the risk of heart disease and meat is frequently associated with outbreaks of food poisoning. Meanwhile, people's insatiable desire for meat might lead to intensive livestock farming and animal slaughter, which has a direct impact on the well-being of animals worldwide.

  From the preceding discussion, one can see no reason why livestock or some other animals cannot be used as food. Swithcing to an animal-free diet is a personal option, but the question remains whether one can ensure sufficient intake of nutrition necessary for one's health. When there is little room for argument concerning the use of animals for meat, it is necessary to impose standards and prevent animal exploitation.

## `4. Some people hold that we should spend money and time on the protection of wild animals while others suggest that the money should be spent on populations living in the poorest areas of the world. What is your opinion?`

  In these years, animal protection has become a subject of ongoing scientific research and an issue of concern. People take different views toward the enormous spending required by wildlife conservation. It is suggested that the spending should be diverted to helping human populations, especially thoe living below poverty line, because human life is more valuable than animal life. In my opinion, the investment in animal conservation is worthwhile.

  Animals, as a significant part of an ecosystem, have profound impacts on the sustainability of an ecosystem and on the well-being of humanity. All animals are connected in one way or another in food chains. For this reason, the demise of a species can lead to overpopulation or underpopulation of another species and then put this species at the verge of extinction. The natural balance will be disrupted and the ecosystem cannot be sustained. It would disable vegetation from purifying water, recycling nutrient and pollinating crops. We humans are eventually affected.

  Another justification for animal protection is that animals play a significant role in the development of industries, as an important natural resource. People derive substances and materials from animals for different purposes. A typical example is that animals provide essential substances for drug-making . It is also very common that designers and engineers turn to wildlife for inspiration. For
