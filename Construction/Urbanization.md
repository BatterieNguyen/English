### Some people suggest that the government should spend money putting more works of art like paintings and statues into towns and cities to make them attractive places. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

### `Braintorming`

### 1. Housing Shortage

Another objection to this idea is that the housing capacity and other facilties of cities to support the increasing population nowadays seems to be threatened by the encroachments of public arts. In fact, the accelerating settlements of people within the cities now, or in the near future, lead to first the overpopulation, later the housing shortages. The needs of consutrcting more accommodations to provide adequate shelter should be prioritized in association with other public facilities, such as schools, hospitals, bus stops, and so on, in order to maintaining the living standards of citizens. The display of public arts without planning, in this sense, may hamper the government from fulfilling the necessary functionality of the whole city. 

### 2. Values
the dispayment of public art is more complicated than it seem to be when it depends much on the context, history, and norms associated with communities. In some cases, putting those visual art forms in the public areas without considerating those criterias would make them become more meaningless than what they are expect to be. It is not to say that those consutrcting public arts may involve the government's sources, including land, human resource, and expenditures. 

___=> Thus, The indiscretion of displaying art works possess nothing but posing a burden upon the national budget.___

In this sense, those public arts seems to possess no aesthetical values as it is expected to express.
