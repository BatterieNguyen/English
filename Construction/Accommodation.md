### Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. Which solution is better?

There is no solution which one is considered to be better than another as the differences in the housing planning result from the different living preferences of the population.
	
 Thanks to the invention of architecture, the new design of high apartment buildings now can optimize the use of lands, minimizing the risk of overpopulation in large cities. As those promising lands with many job opportunities attract more people coming, It would highlight the need to seek  new houses for people’s  new resettlement. By constructing those building complexes, people are provided with more residential areas. Even if the urban development can accommodate the increasing population without consideration of taller buildings, with the passing of time, overpopulation will soon be the most concern for both government and residents.
	
 In addition to providing accommodation for residents, there is a concrete link between this new city planning and the quality of people’s lives. The more availability of land means the  more constructions of public facilities such as schools and hospitals. It could be much easier for people to receive education and proper healthcare services. From there, people are allowed to meet basic needs, thereby maintaining the living standards.
	
 While the platform of tall buildings is suitable for city living, houses using more land can be dominant in suburban areas where it enables multigenerational households and good physical health. Compared to cities with increasing population, those rural lands accommodate less residents, and thus more lands are available to families with larger size. The share of the household may strengthen the bonds between family members with multiple generations. Another point is that those space-consuming houses encourage people to enjoy more outdoor activities. Thus, doing exercises or playing sports in the house garden helps people reduce the risk of obesity and other physical illnesses, thereby improving people’s health.
	
 As suggested above, while constructing departments are necessary for areas  with increasing population, land-consuming houses help people share households with multiple generations and lead a healthier lifestyle. There is not a clear-cut distinction between what is considered to be better as the living demands of each individual are not similar.
