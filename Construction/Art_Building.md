### _Some people suggest that the government should spend money putting more works of art like paintings and statues into towns and cities to make them attractive places. To what extent do you agree or disagree?_

### `Braintorming`

#### 1. Housing Shortage

Another objection to this idea is that the housing capacity and other facilties of cities to support the increasing population nowadays seems to be threatened by the encroachments of public arts. In fact, the accelerating settlements of people within the cities now, or in the near future, lead to first the overpopulation, later the housing shortages. The needs of consutrcting more accommodations to provide adequate shelter should be prioritized in association with other public facilities, such as schools, hospitals, bus stops, and so on, in order to maintaining the living standards of citizens. The display of public arts without planning, in this sense, may hamper the government from fulfilling the necessary functionality of the whole city. 

#### 2. Values
the dispayment of public art is more complicated than it seem to be when it depends much on the context, history, and norms associated with communities. In some cases, putting those visual art forms in the public areas without considerating those criterias would make them become more meaningless than what they are expect to be. It is not to say that those consutrcting public arts may involve the government's sources, including land, human resource, and expenditures. 

___=> Thus, The indiscretion of displaying art works possess nothing but posing a burden upon the national budget.___

In this sense, those public arts seems to possess no aesthetical values as it is expected to express.


### `Outcome`

The ideas of putting visual art forms in the residential areas seems to be unpractical

### _It is more important for a building to service its purpose than to look beautiful. Architects do not need to worry about whether it is a real work of art. Do you agree or disagree?_
### `Sample`

  Buildings, not very different from other commodities, perform various functions and serve varying needs of their users. At the centre of the controversy is whether the purposes of a building should be placed above its aesthetical values. As far as I am concerned, these two qualities are not conflicting, but mutually beneficial.

  In a modern society, aesthetical considerations are no longer considered as insignificant or luxury but have been integrated as a core function of a building. People have comprehensive requirements on a building. No longer limited to such ordinary functions, such as safety, durability, space, access to facilities, their interests involve decorative details and visual qualities, including ornamentation and furnishings. In simple terms a pedestrian-looking building is bound to mismatch the trend of the market.

  Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that some types of building are broadly expected by the public to possess aesthical values. Standard examples include restaurants, theaters, churches and so forth. A building falling in these categories desires a  design of originality and rarity, aiming to distinguish itself from other constructions of its kind or those in its surroundings. Architects' inspiration add values to the building and increase its marketability. Many buildings have become sybolic in the city or region where they are located.

  When being concerned with the aesthetic aspect of architecture, people should consider economic feasibility. The focus on the exterior of a building alone will lead to the increase in construction cost, making such an endeavor unjustified. In those cities where overpopulation continues to be a problem and many people cannot afford housing, whether a building looks beautiful would not be taken seriously. In that situation, the rationale is to accommodate a huge population, rather than simply please the eye.

  Based on the arguments outlined above, adding visual appeals to a building is consistent with the needs of a modern sciety. However, it does not mean that the concern on aesthetics should be at the expense of a building's practical function; on the contrary, a building should be the result of the delicate balance between the two ideals.
