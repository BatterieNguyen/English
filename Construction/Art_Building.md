### _It is more important for a building to service its purpose than to look beautiful. Architects do not need to worry about whether it is a real work of art. Do you agree or disagree?_

  Buildings, not very different from other commodities, perform various functions and serve varying needs of their users. At the cntre of the controversy is whether the purposes of a building should be placed above its aesthetical values. As far as I am concerned, these two qualities are not conflicting, but mutually beneficial.
