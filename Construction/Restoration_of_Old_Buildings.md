### Restoration of old buildings in main cities involves enormous government expenditure. It would be more beneficial to spend this money to build new houses and roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.

### `Brainstorming`
#### 1. Agree
* With the buildings processing no specific value while becoming dilapidated, destruction is acceptable, reasonable → [...] → whether they have been renovated or not/ Suppose those buildings have been undergone the process of renovation, those still provide no justification for continued maintenance.
> * With the passing of time, those old buildings would run down  → eventually, turn into a place where people could not comfortably live there → the low in quality and poor in conditions of them may pose a danger to residents and pedestrians.
> * Impede other forms of urban development → become out-dated/ decaying → blemish the landscape and no longer suit the building standards of users → a knock-down rebuild can meet the renewed needs of the city.

#### 2. Disagree
* Some old buildings are much more important than the new ones/ perform more functions than the new ones do → 
> * Uniqueness, be considered as historical attractions/ heritages/ sites → drive the attention of tourists, public → increase the cash flow of nations, and provide a source of tourism income.
> * heritage reasons: have aesthetic, architectural, archaeological values → portray the history of generations, architectural and design features that are no longer used/ available today → maintain the connection to our past, bring certain character, charm to neighborhoods →  knocking down those historical buildings, may cause damage to historical heritage, traditional culture of that nation → in another word, without such buildings, it would diminish nations’ heritage and sense of pride → should maintain the unique and original design.
> * In the domain of architecture: Many architectures may fail to draw inspiration from their predecessors.
- construction waste greatly impacts the environment → preserving the old buildings can reduce the waste and have an optimal use of resources involved in building new materials
- save a significant amount of money, time and effort
> * more affordable → keep the interior design and reinforce the structure → for the fraction of the price, provide the adequate strength and revamp the appearance without interfering with the original condition.


### `Outcome`
  After achieving enough of the need for shelter among the basic human needs, people turn to higher building standards. It starts to confront a constant debate whether or not a new city planning is necessary in order to improve citizens living standards. In my opinion, decisions should be made after taking those targeted buildings into consideration regarding the needs of the city.

  Believe it or not, some old buildings are integral, still functioning as symbols of cities or even its nation. Thus, knocking down such of them may put the architectural and archaeological values at a risk of disappearance. In other words, only by maintaining them, countries can preserve the historical heritage and in the domain of the architecture, the contemporaries may succeed to draw inspiration from their predecessors. To a broader extent, as historical sites, their uniqueness can attract visitors, providing a source of tourism income. In this sense, there is a possibility that people may fail to recognize functions that these traditional buildings can perform and renovating them is an investing activity.
	
 I also believe that we should only replace buildings with no specific value to residential areas but become dilapidated, with the passing of time. The low quality and poor conditions would turn those departments, for example, into places where citizens could not comfortably live and eventually, pose a danger to residents' safety. Suppose the State budget is used to repurpose those residential areas, they still remain out-dated design features, thereby impeding the form of urban development or blemishing the landscape. Therefore, It is true to say that there is no justification for continued maintenance and a knock-down rebuild is understandable to meet the renewed needs of the city.
	
 As mentioned above, there are some targeted buildings that can have more functions than others do. Both the government and people involved should be cautious about the role of each targeted building before reaching decisions.
